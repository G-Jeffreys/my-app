## 1. Purpose & Background

A next-generation social media platform that revolutionizes ephemeral content sharing through **intelligent AI summaries**. Unlike Snapchat and other disappearing content platforms, every photo, video, and message generates smart, context-aware summaries that preserve the essence of shared moments while maintaining complete media privacy. This "smart ephemeral" approach gives users the freedom to share authentically knowing their memories are intelligently preserved, without the anxiety of permanent digital footprints.

**Target Market**: Gen Z and millennial social media users who want the spontaneity of ephemeral sharing with the intelligence of AI-powered memory preservation.

**Current Status**: Core social platform (Phase 1) is **fully implemented**. Advanced AI social features (Phase 2) are **scaffolded and ready for activation**.

| **VID4** | *As a privacy-conscious user*, video content moderation automatically detects inappropriate visual content before sharing | Vision-based content moderation with 98%+ accuracy for video | üéØ **STRETCH GOAL** |

#### Technical Requirements
- **Vision Model Integration**: GPT-4V or specialized video analysis models for frame-by-frame understanding
- **Video Processing Pipeline**: Keyframe extraction, scene segmentation, and temporal analysis
- **Enhanced Moderation**: Computer vision-based content safety for video streams
- **Performance Targets**: Video summary generation within 10s P95 for ‚â§10s videos

#### Implementation Approach
1. **Phase 1**: Keyframe extraction and static image analysis of video frames
2. **Phase 2**: Temporal video analysis for action and movement recognition  
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced scene understanding and social context integration
4. **Phase 4**: Real-time video processing for live content analysis

### üì± **Push Notifications**

**Priority**: Essential for user engagement and real-time social interaction

**Description**: Implement intelligent push notification system that respects ephemeral content privacy while maximizing social engagement and timely content delivery.

#### User Stories
| User Story ID | Story | Acceptance Criteria | Implementation Status |
| ------------- | ----- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| **PUSH1** | *As a social user*, I receive immediate notifications when friends share content, ensuring I don't miss ephemeral moments | Real-time push notifications with <5s delivery time | üéØ **STRETCH GOAL** |
| **PUSH2** | *As a friend*, I get smart notifications that prioritize close friends and active conversations without overwhelming me | AI-powered notification prioritization based on social graph | üéØ **STRETCH GOAL** |
| **PUSH3** | *As a group member*, I receive group-specific notifications for shared content with intelligent batching to avoid spam | Group notification management with customizable settings | üéØ **STRETCH GOAL** |
| **PUSH4** | *As a content creator*, I can see delivery confirmations and know when friends have been notified about my shared content | Notification delivery tracking and analytics | üéØ **STRETCH GOAL** |
| **PUSH5** | *As a privacy-focused user*, I can customize notification content to balance engagement with privacy preferences | Granular notification privacy controls and content masking | üéØ **STRETCH GOAL** |

#### Notification Types
- **Immediate Social**: New content from close friends (highest priority)
- **Group Activity**: Group conversations and shared moments (medium priority)  
- **Memory Insights**: AI-generated summaries and memory discoveries (low priority)
- **System Updates**: Friend requests, content expiration warnings (as needed)

#### Technical Requirements
- **Multi-Platform Support**: iOS APNs, Android FCM, and web push notifications
- **Intelligent Batching**: Group multiple notifications to prevent notification fatigue
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Notification content respects ephemeral content principles
- **Performance Targets**: 95% delivery success rate within 5 seconds

#### Implementation Approach
1. **Phase 1**: Basic push notification infrastructure with Firebase Cloud Messaging
2. **Phase 2**: Smart notification prioritization based on social relationships
3. **Phase 3**: AI-powered notification content optimization and batching
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced analytics and personalized notification strategies

### üîó **Integration with Core Platform**

Both stretch goals integrate seamlessly with existing architecture:

**Video Summaries**: Extend current AI processing pipeline to include video analysis workers
**Push Notifications**: Leverage existing social graph and engagement analytics for intelligent delivery

**Resource Requirements**: Additional OpenAI API costs for vision models, Firebase Cloud Messaging setup, enhanced Cloud Run compute for video processing

**Success Metrics**:
- Video summaries: 80% user satisfaction with video content understanding
- Push notifications: 40% increase in content engagement within first hour of sharing

## 15. Out‚Äëof‚ÄëScope (Current Version)

### **Not Currently Implemented**
- **Advanced Video Content Analysis**: Intelligent video summarization beyond basic placeholders (see Section 14 - Stretch Goals)
- **Push Notification System**: Real-time user engagement notifications (see Section 14 - Stretch Goals)
- **Video Frame Extraction**: Keyframe analysis for video content understanding
- **Advanced Video Moderation**: Vision-based analysis of video content streams

### **Future Considerations Beyond Stretch Goals**
- Advanced conversation analytics dashboard
- Multi-language AI support  
- Voice message transcription and analysis
- Custom AI model training for personalized content understanding
- Real-time collaborative content creation

**Note**: Core ephemeral messaging and group chat features are **fully implemented and production-ready**. AI features are ready for text and image content, with video content receiving basic placeholder summaries pending stretch goal implementation.
